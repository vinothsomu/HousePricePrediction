# House Price Prediction Assignment
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. Model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
> This assignment is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the house property.
Target Variable: SalePrice
> Identify which variables are significant in predicting the sales price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house. Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
